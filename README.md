# about-me
About me project for week 1 of Code 201.


## The Mission

This is the first project in of my jurney to being a software developer. 
I want it to be as useful as humanly possible.

## Build Status

This is the very first day, so 'Under Construction' is an accurate description for the moment.

## Continuum

As I'm continuing to build, I will extend it with more categories, but for now it's just really simple.
